1) In bubble sort the time complexity is T(n)=O(n^2)  ( Worst case)., we create an unsorted  array., and use 2 for loops(nested loops) ., 1st loop  :: to push the large element to last index., 2nd for loop:: to make multiple comparisions and  swap operations  bwn two succesive adjacent elements!! (Here we sort elements from last index!!!)   (a[j],a[j+1],a[i] ,temp)

2) Selection sort:: the time complexity is T(n)=O(n^2) ., here also we create an array function to create an array(unsorted array)., In main method we insert array elements and call the function.., WE use 2 for loops ., 1st for loop : it  intially fixes the first element of first index as smaller and stored in var ,agaiin we create 2nd loop (runs from 2nd index element coz we already fixed 1st element) he we do operation of comparing from 2nd index element with smaller element i.e stored in var  j=s (a[i]=s>> temp=a[s], a[i]=a[s], a[s]=temp)... Sorting takes place from starting index
