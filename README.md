1) In bubble sort the time complexity is T(n)=O(n^2)  ( Worst case)., we create an unsorted  array., and use 2 for loops(nested loops) ., 1st loop  :: to push the large element to last index., 2nd for loop:: to make multiple comparisions and  swap operations  bwn two succesive adjacent elements!! (Here we sort elements from last index!!!)   (a[j],a[j+1],a[i] ,temp)

2) Selection sort:: the time complexity is T(n)=O(n^2) ., here also we create an array function to create an array(unsorted array)., In main method we insert array elements and call the function.., WE use 2 for loops ., 1st for loop : it  intially fixes the first element of first index as smaller and stored in var ,agaiin we create 2nd loop (runs from 2nd index element coz we already fixed 1st element) he we do operation of comparing from 2nd index element with smaller element i.e stored in var  j=s (a[i]=s>> temp=a[s], a[i]=a[s], a[s]=temp)... Sorting takes place from starting index

3) Insertiion sort:: the time complexity is T(n)=O(n^2) in worst case ., and in best/avg case T(n)=O(n)., Even in insertion sort we consider an unsorted array, here we consider only 1 for loop (to fix the  current index position), Let i be the  1st var, and also consider 2nd var situated just before 1st var.. We will compare a[j] and a[j+1] values if a[j] is greater then perform shifting operation.. , here we won't apply swap operation., we push the larger element to forward and move the smaller val to temp and decrement the j pointer., i.e the smaller val a[j+1] will be placed in current indexed var. { i)Initially we create 2 pointers(i,j) ., j should be prev to i  ., ii) Check the condition in while loop , if j val greater  perform shifting iii) push the a[j+1] to current position if its smaller.}
